#This makefile is designed to compile and link a simple CUDA application.
#This Makefile is designed to be located in the same directory as your source code
#*********************************************************************
#To use this makefile you must make modifications where "TODO" appears.
#There you will specify the name of the final executable and the object
#files (.o files) needed to form the executable.
#*********************************************************************
#
#The most common usage will be "make all", which will compile all .cu files
#that have the same name as the .o files mentioned in OBJS, and then link
#them to form the executable, a file whose name is the value of EXECUTABLE.
#
#If you want to compile a single .cu file, say, foo.cu, use the command
#"make foo.o"
#
#If you want to force a complete rebuild, use these commands in sequence:
#"make clean"
#"make all"

#In general this will be a xxx.o for each xxx.cu file.  Example:
#OBJS=first.o main.o

#The following could be used in place of the default rule, replacing matrix_cuda with 
#the actual file names.  Would also put names of the user defined .h files that the
#CU files includes on the right

#This is the default rule for compiling cu files into corresponding object files
#Evidently, the include directories for cuda files are part of NVCC   
#-G generates debugging code for device, -g for the host.
#-O is the optimization level for host code
#-x cu specifies that the input file is to be treated as a cuda file, independent of the filename suffix
#-o specifies the name of the resulting object file
